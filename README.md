Final project for Geography 458, using HTML and JavaScript to create and style a story map. Python was used to clean, filter, and combine the data. The project looks at global greenhouse gas emissions per capita by country and takes a closer look at two countries with similar population densities but very different emissions to explore what might be causing the differences.
